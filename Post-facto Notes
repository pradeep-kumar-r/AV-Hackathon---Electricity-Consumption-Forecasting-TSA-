Note: 
We are building a simple forecasting solution consisting of a Naive Forecast as benchmark and a DL model (LSTM with a basic architecture) as our model. The labels are not present in the Test data since this was a hackathon. So, we've trained the model on our entire training data and only added dropout regularization to minimize overfitting. This is not the ideal way to train our model. Better alternatives would ne splliting the given train set further into a true training & validation set to ensure the model generalizes well.

Scope of improvement: 

It can even be bettered through:
      adding more layers (changing the architecture)
      more complex activation functions like ReLU or Leaky ReLU to bake in non-linearity
      experiemnting with different architecture, activation functions, optimizers like adam with GRID searches
      Trying GRUs instead of LSTMs
